                        <p>“I would say that while my GPA is not reflective of the quality of work I can produce, my overall grades are. When I first started college, I struggled in my freshman year with some of the core classes I needed to take, and a few of the grades in those courses, unfortunately, brought down my overall GPA. However, once I completed those initial core classes, my grades were above average in all the classes I took for my major. I believe those grades are more reflective of my ability to produce quality work in this position.”</p>
